My name is Mustafa Ehsan, a web developer from Kabul, Afghanistan. I know PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, JavaScript and some others, I am a [Laravel](https://laravel.com) contributer and lover of it's community. I have also worked with a bunch of other front-end and back-end technologies.

I want to get deep into best software development practices, such as clean coding, design patterns, testing, BDD, enterprise application architecture, etc.

In this blog I would like to share my programming knowledge, skills, stuff I learn and research I do on some topics.

Applogise for my bad English :).
